### About:

<br>

> **The main motivator for this project was my curiosity** as well as my desire to expand my knowledge. Due to the disastrous effect **the pandemic had on the small businesses** I used to visit, I decided I wanted to find a way to create websites and e-commerce stores that any business owner could use to represent their wares online, be it small or big. <br>
> Although it isn't fully functional yet, as there is a final error I have to correct to publish it on the web, this is the result of my work.
> **Aside from that I wasn't entirely satisfied with the design so I customized it** as you can see from the preview shown above.
