### About:

> **I started this project out of curiosity**, I wanted to see the **advantages & disadvantages** in building an e-commerce app using React, **Commercejs and stripe** and an app build with (Mongodb, Express, React and Nodejs | **MERN**). <br> <br> **PROS:** Its certainly faster to build, in more of that **commercejs** has some nice tools to communicate with the client. **CONS:** as a beginner I like to have the code in front of me to see from where an issue is coming

<br>
<br>

## The Default version

<br>

> - The Default version only contains the **necessary** in terms of **styles**, the important here was the **functionality**.
